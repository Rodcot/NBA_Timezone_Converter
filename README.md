# NBA Timezone Converter Chrome Extension
Change the times listed for current NBA games on the NBA league pass website (nba.com) to your local timezone
instead of the standard Eastern Time that is used on the website. This isn't an option in any of the settings
so using this extension is the only way to avoid having to convert the time manually.
